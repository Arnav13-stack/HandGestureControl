# ✋🖥️ Hand Gesture Control System

A powerful Python-based **hand gesture recognition system** that lets users **control volume**, **move the cursor**, and **shut down tasks** using just their hand gestures — no mouse, no keyboard, just your hand in front of the camera!

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔊 **Volume Control (Pinch Gesture)**
- When **thumb and index finger come closer** ➡️ 🔉 Volume **decreases**
- When **thumb and index finger move apart** ➡️ 🔊 Volume **increases**

### 🖱️ **Cursor Control (Open Palm)**
- A **straight open palm** acts as a **virtual mouse cursor**, allowing you to move the pointer around the screen.

### ❌ **Shut Task (Hand Flip Gesture)**
- **Flipping your hand** (palm facing away from camera) triggers a command to **close/terminate the current running task** (e.g., closes a media player, app, or shuts the bot).
